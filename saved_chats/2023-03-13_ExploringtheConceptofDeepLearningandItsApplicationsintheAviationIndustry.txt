user: What is deep learning?
assistant: 

Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that involves training artificial neural networks with a large amount of data to solve complex problems. These neural networks are composed of layers of interconnected nodes that process information and learn to make predictions or decisions by adjusting the weights of the connections between the nodes. Deep learning has achieved notable success in areas such as image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition, and has been used to create applications such as self-driving cars, intelligent personal assistants, and facial recognition systems.
user: , can i use deep learning to fly a plane?
assistant: Deep learning has been used in the aviation industry for various purposes, such as predicting the weather and optimizing fuel consumption. However, it is not currently feasible to use deep learning to fly a plane autonomously without human intervention. The aviation industry heavily relies on safety protocols and regulations, and the risk of using AI (including deep learning) as the sole decision-maker for a complex task such as flying a plane is likely to be perceived as too great at this point.
