TEXT = """ OpenAI provides a toolkit called "OpenAI API" that allows you to compute multi-head self-attention for a given text. The OpenAy I A Pi I provides access to a range of pre-trained language models, such as Gee Pee Tee 2 and Gee Pee Tee 3, which are capable of performing multi-head self-attention on text data.
To use the OpenAI API, you first need to sign up for an API key and then import the A P I client into your Python environment. Once you have set up the A P I client, you can use it to send requests to the OpenAI API server, which will process your text data and return a response containing the multi-head self-attention weights.
The OpenAI API offers a simple and straightforward way to access powerful language models and compute complex natural language processing tasks, such as multi-head self-attention, without the need for extensive computational resources or expertise in machine learning.
